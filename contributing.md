With your help we can improve this project radically. Ways you can help:
- Solving Issues
- Creating Issues for adding a functionality
- Doing code review
- Reporting a bug by adding it as an issue

## Few Guidelines

- Be consistent with your coding style
- Write concise [commit messages](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/writing-good-commit-messages-a-practical-guide/)
- Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests).
- If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
